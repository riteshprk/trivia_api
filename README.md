# Full Stack API Project

## Full Stack Trivia

Trivia API is a webapp used to provide API data of Question and answers based on category and difficulty level to play as a game. 

The app has following functionality:

1) Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions should show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer. 
2) Delete questions.
3) Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4) Search for questions based on a text query string.
5) Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.
